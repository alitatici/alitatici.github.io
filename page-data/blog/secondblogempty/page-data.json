Today's topic is that using Microsoft Word automatically through Python. </p>\n<h2>WHY</h2>\n<p>First of all, one of the main motivations to start coding was easing the works about my profession, civil engineering. For this reason, I have to learn at least these three tasks which I also mentioned in <a href=\"https://alitalhaatici.com/blog/firstblogandhatilapp/\" title=\"First Blog &#x26; HatilApp\">my first blog</a>:</p>\n<p>1- How to code calculation</p>\n<p>2- How to write up report</p>\n<p>3- How to make AutoCAD drawing</p>\n<p>So, by automatizing Microsoft Word with Python, second task will be completed.</p>\n<h2>HOW</h2>\n<p>You can find out many webpages about the topic, yet I used a few of them since I want to share something fundamental about this for now.
